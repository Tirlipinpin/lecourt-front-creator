## Running the project
Actually, this step is very simple. Just run:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
or
```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

There you go.

When you want to push some code, don't forget to check your CI tests. You can launch the process with
```bash
$ npm test
```
or
```bash
$ yarn test
```

An important thing is to keep a good coverage for the app, so when you update some code, be sure to update the test that comes with it.

And you're done. Have fun!
